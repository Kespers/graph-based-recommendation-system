# Recommendatiom System with Graph Embeddings
This project explores a Graph Neural Network-based approach to movie recommendation.

Using the [MovieLens 100k](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872) dataset we generate embeddings for users and movies from a bipartite graph built on user-movie interactions (ratings), and use these embeddings to predict unseen ratings via a regression model.
